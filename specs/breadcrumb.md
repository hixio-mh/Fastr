# Breadcrumb

## Overview
A `fast-breadcrumb` component is used as a navigational aid, allowing users to maintain awareness of their locations within a program, app, or a website.

### Use Cases
- James is browsing an ecommerce website and is looking for a few items to add to his new kitchen. He needs a knife set, and an espresso machine. He checks out `Home and Kitchen` page, then selects `Kitchen and Dining`, first category he picks is `Cutlery`, he finds the sets of knives. There is now a breadcrumb trail of the pages James has clicked through. `Home and Kitchen /  Kitchen and Dining / Cutlery / Knife Sets`
He clicks on `Kitchen and Dining` to go back to the category of kitchen items, selects `Coffee and Espresso` finds the best one that suits his needs. If James wants to continue looking for another item for his kitchen, or other things for his home, he just needs to click on any of the links in the breadcrumb trail to continue his search.

*Component Name*
- `fast-breadcrumb`

*Properties*
- `slottedBreadcrumbItems` - HTMLElement[] used in the slotted directive.

*Attribute*
- `aria-labelledby`
- `aria-label`

*Slot Names*
- slotted directive, with a property called `slottedBreadcrumbItems`.

### Anatomy and Appearance

```html
<template
    role="navigation"
    aria-label="${x => x.ariaLabel}"
    aria-labelledby="${x => x.ariaLabelledby}"
>
    <div role="list">
        <slot ${slotted({ property: "slottedBreadcrumbItems", filter: elements() })}></slot>
    </div>
</template>
```

---

## Implementation

```html
<fast-breadcrumb>
    <fast-breadcrumb-item name="Home" href="#"></fast-breadcrumb-item>
    <fast-breadcrumb-item name="Template" href="#"></fast-breadcrumb-item>
    <fast-breadcrumb-item name="Template Prices" href="#"></fast-breadcrumb-item>
</fast-breadcrumb>
```

### Accessibility

The breadcrumb should align to the interaction model provided by the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#breadcrumb)
- `aria-current` - W3 specs says when using `aria-current="page"` the element should be a link. `fast-breadcrumb` will set `aria-current="page"` to the last element if there is an href attribute.

### Globalization

The overall order inside the breadcrumb will be reversed when switching in LTR/RTL.

### Test Plan

While testing is still TBD for our web components, I would expect this to align with the testing strategy and not require any additional test support.
