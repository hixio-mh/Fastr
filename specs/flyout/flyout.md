# Popover (aka Flyout)
## Overview
Popover is a focusable floating container that shows over a pages content and displays UI related to what the user is doing and is typically triggered by a clickable element. Similar to a Dialog, but with positioning controls, no overlay option, and no specific action is required, a Popover can be used to reveal a secondary control or show more detail about an item.

### Background
A Popover can be less intrusive to the user experience than a Dialog and should be used instead of a Dialog when information or input is needed to be displayed, but not in the center of the screen, such as in the case of collection of additional info before an action, displaying information that is only relevant some of the time, or just displaying more information.

### Use Cases
- As a popup showing additional info for an item on the page.
- To display a larger image of a thumbnail image in a photo gallery.
- To display an action related to a page item.

### Features
**Placement Logic:** - This component will use *Anchored Region* to be positioned relative to the Popover anchor element. This way it can be dynamic and adapt to the available space.

**Soft Dismiss (aka Light Dismiss):** - A way to quickly close the Popover by clicking outside it, or pressing the `esc` key. An event would be emitted anytime the Popover is dismissed. The Popover would always be soft-dismissable. Detecting the users next click of a different element can trigger this when clicking outside the Popover.

**Focus Management:** - Should follow the same process for focus management as a Dialog primarily as the Popover's role will be dialog. This includes a trap focus method, which can be optional. For accessibility the focus should return to the target that triggers the popover after the popover is closed.

### API
*Component Name*
- `fast-popover`

*Attributes*
- `target` - string, the html id of the HTMLElement that the Popover is attached to, (viewport for anchored region defaults to the parent of the anchor) and triggered by
- `visible` - boolean, whether or not the Popover is visible, defaults to undefined, as this is controlled by the author
- `delay` - number, the time delay before the popover is shown once triggered
- `position` - enum, where the tooltip should appear relative to its target, uses Anchored Region logic

    - above-centered, below-centered

    - right-centered, left-centered

- `aria-labelledby` - optional based on implementation**
- `aria-describedby` - optional based on implementation**
- `aria-label` - optional, based on implementation**

    ** See the [W3C Specification](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/#dialog_roles_states_props) for requirements and details.

*Properties*
- `targetElement` - the reference to the HTMLElement used as an anchor
- `viewportElement` - the reference to the HTMLElement used as the viewport, required ot setup anchored region properly
- `popoverVisible` - boolean, whether or not the Popover is visible

*Slots*
- default for content

*Events*
- `dismiss` - event fired when the Popover is dismissed

*Functions*
- `createPopoverTemplate(string: prefix)` - generates a `ViewTemplate` for the popover based on the given provided prefix string. This is required as popover uses an `anchored-region` internally and the create function generates a template using the appropriate `anchored-region` tag (ie "fast-anchored-region", "fluent-anchored-region"). Note that the appropriate `anchored-region` component must also be declared.

### Anatomy and Appearance
Parts:
- `popover` - the popover itself, has `role=dialog`
- `anchored-region` - the anchored region that controls the position of the popover


*Template:*
**ASK (2)**
```html
${when(
    x => x.visible,
    html<Popover>`
        <div>
            <fast-anchored-region
                anchor="${x => x.targetElement}"
                vertical-positioning-mode="dynamic"
                horizontal-positioning-mode="dynamic"
                horizontal-default-position="${x => x.getHorizontalPosition()}"
                vertical-default-position="${x => x.getVerticalPosition()}"
                horizontal-inset="${x => x.getHorizontalInset()}"
                vertical-inset="${x => x.getVerticalInset()}"
                ${ref("anchoredRegion")}
            >
                <div
                    class="content"
                    part="content"
                    role="dialog"
                >
                    <slot></slot>
                </div>
            </fast-anchored-region>
        </div>
    `
)}
```

---

## Implementation
```html
<fast-popover visible>
    <p>This is a popover</p>
    <fast-button>Action</fast-button>
</fast-popover>
```

### States
`visible` - Whether or not Popover is hidden. This state is managed solely by the app author via the visible attribute.

### Accessibility
*Keyboard Navigation and Focus*
Keyboard and navigation will follow the same rules as Dialog per the [W3C Specification](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/#dialog_modal), expect when there is no focusable content then the Popover itself will receive focus.

### Globalization
The component visuals should change when in RTL scenarios as the component is positioned relative to it's anchor.

### Dependencies
This component should be positioned using [anchored region](../packages/web-components/fast-foundation/src/anchored-region/anchored-region.spec.md).
