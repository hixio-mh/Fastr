#### Who is behind FAST-DNA?

The Microsoft FAST-DNA team, part of the Edge organization, builds and maintains all the `@microsoft/fast-*` packages. We are a collection of UX Engineers and Designers who are passionate about solving real-world UX challenges using web standard technologies. You can find us on GitHub [here](https://github.com/microsoft/fast-dna).

#### What does FAST-DNA stand for?

When the project was originally founded, the FAST-DNA acronym stood for "Functional, Adaptive, Secure, and Timeless Design Network Architecture". Sometimes we simply refer to the project as "FAST" which reflects our desire to create libraries and tools that enable leading designer and developer productivity.

#### How does `fast-element` compare to "Framework X"?

At this time, `fast-element` has a focus that's a bit different from the typical front-end framework. Rather than focusing on being a "mega SPA framework", `fast-element` endeavors to enable the creation of web components. As a result, you can use `fast-element` or any component built on `fast-element` in tandem with your favorite front-end framework.
