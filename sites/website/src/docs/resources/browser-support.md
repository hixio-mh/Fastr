The following browsers have native support for the Web Components features used by `fast-element` and our components:

* Microsoft Edge 79+
* Mozilla Firefox 63+
* Google Chrome 67+
* Apple Safari 10.1+
* Opera 41+
* iOS Safari 10.3+
* Android Browser 81+
* Opera Mobile 46+
* Chrome for Android 81+
* Firefox for Android 68+
* Samsung Internet 6.2+

It is possible to use `fast-element` and our components in older browsers, but polyfills are required and won't perform as well as the native implementations. For more information on leveraging polyfills [see the webcomponents/polyfills project](https://github.com/webcomponents/polyfills/tree/master/packages/webcomponentsjs) on GitHub.
