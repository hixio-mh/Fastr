# Migrating from v1 to v2

This guide aims to help you migrate from `@microsoft/fast-element`, `@microsoft/fast-foundation`, and `@microsoft/fast-components` v1 to v2.

## Updated component exports

If you have been using the `@microsoft/fast-components` package, the named exports have changed. They are now functions and are camelCase.

Example:
```js
import { fastButton, fastCheckbox } from "@microsoft/fast-components";
```

These functions must be registered with a `DesignSystem`.

## Registering components with the Design System

A new export is available from `@microsoft/fast-foundation`, the `DesignSystem`. If you have been importing the web component class and declaring it in a script file to prevent it from tree shaking, you must instead register FAST components from `@microsoft/fast-components` with the `DesignSystem`.

Example:
```js
import { DesignSystem } from "@microsoft/fast-foundation";
import {
    fastButton,
    fastCheckbox,
} from "@microsoft/fast-components";

DesignSystem.getOrCreate().register(
    fastButton(),
    fastCheckbox(),
);
```

## Creating components that can register with the Design System

Component creation remains largely unchanged, however the method of extending from the `FASTElement` does not work if the intention is to register the component with the `DesignSystem` in the same way that FAST components from the `@microsoft/fast-components` package are now registered.

### Templates & styles

The templates and styles should now be functions which can accept context and definition which will be provided during composition.

Example template:
```js
import { html } from "@microsoft/fast-element";

export const myComponentTemplate: (context, definition) => {
    return html`
        <template></template>
    `;
}
```

Example style:
```js
import { css } from "@microsoft/fast-element";

export const myComponentStyles: (context, definition) => {
    return css`
        :host {
            background-color: red;
        }
    `;
}
```

### Defining the class

Although the `FASTElement` class can still be used to extend from using the v1 method, to allow for registration with the `DesignSystem` there is a new element, the `FASTFoundation` export from `@microsoft/fast-foundation`. 

Example:
```js
import { FoundationElement } from "@microsoft/fast-foundation";

export class MyComponent extends FoundationElement {
    // component attrs, observables, and logic
}
```

### Composing components using FASTFoundation

Composing components now uses the `compose` method provided by the `FoundationElement`.

Example:
```js
import { myComponentTemplate } from "./my-component-template";
import { myComponentStyles } from "./my-component-styles";

export const myComponent = MyComponent.compose({
    baseName: "my-component",
    template: myComponentTemplate,
    styles: myComponentStyles,
});
```

This export can now be [registered](#registering-components-with-the-design-system) with the `DesignSystem`.
