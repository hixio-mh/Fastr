# Text field

## Accessibility

Provide hint text by setting the `placeholder` prop.

A *text field* with the [`readonly`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/text#readonly) attribute is focusable and should have [`aria-label="Read only"`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_aria-label_attribute) set.
