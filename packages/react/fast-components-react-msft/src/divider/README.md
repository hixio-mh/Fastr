# Divider

## Accessibility

Renders as an [`<hr>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/hr) element, which has the default `role` of `"separator"`.

When used for decoration without functional, interactive, or structural relevance implied by the hr element, [`role="presentation"`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_presentation_role) can be applied by setting the `role` prop.
