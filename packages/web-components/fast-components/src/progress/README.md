# fast-progress & fast-progress-ring
Progress components are used to display the length of time a process will take or to visualize percentage value (referred to as a **determinate** state) and to represent an unspecified wait time (referred to as an **indeterminate** state). For progress components which have a linear visual appearance, use `fast-progress`. For progress implementations which are circular, use `fast-progress-ring`.

For more information view the [component specification](../../../fast-foundation/src/progress/progress.spec.md).
