An implementation of an [option](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#option). To avoid namespace collisions with the [Option() constructor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLOptionElement/Option), the component class is `ListboxOption`, and our implementation is named `fast-option`.

The `<fast-option>` component will only provide internals related to form association when used within a form-associated component. See the [`fast-select` component](../select/README.md) for more details.
