The `fast-element` library is a lightweight means to easily building performant, memory-efficient, standards-compliant Web Components. FAST Elements work in every major browser and can be used in combination with any front-end framework or even without a framework.

To install the `fast-element` library, use either `npm` or `yarn` as follows:

```shell
npm install @microsoft/fast-element --save
```

```shell
yarn add @microsoft/fast-element
```

Within your JavaScript or TypeScript code, you can then import library APIs like this:

```ts
import { FASTElement } from '@microsoft/fast-element';
```
