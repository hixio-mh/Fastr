# Metatext

The *metatext* component accepts children and can be either a [`<p>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p) or a [`<span>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/span) element.

Use *metatext* to describe the contents of, give context for, or provide more detail about other text or components. *Metatext* is typically a single piece of data or a sentence fragment without punctuation.

## Usage

Be concise â€” use only one or two words, or a sentence fragment. Use *metatext* sparingly. If long strings, sentences, or paragraphs of text are needed, consider using a paragraph instead.
