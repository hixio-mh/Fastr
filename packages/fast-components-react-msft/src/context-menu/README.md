# Context menu

A generic menu component implementing the [`menu`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#menu) role and the keyboard navigation aligning to that role. A *context menu* will accept any child elements but is built to work with *context menu item* and *divider* components.

## Accessibility

The *context menu* considers a child element focusable when it has a role of `menuitem`, `menuitemradio`, or `menuitemcheckbox` and will manage focus between these elements automatically.
