# Tree View
A TreeView displays a hierarchical set of information such as an outline or folder structure. It is populated with one or more `TreeViewItems`, which may further contain child items. An item that has children can be expanded or collapsed. An item can also be selected, typically supported to present related information in an adjacent panel.

## Accessibility
The *tree view* component is based off the [WAI-ARIA spec](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/#TreeView).
