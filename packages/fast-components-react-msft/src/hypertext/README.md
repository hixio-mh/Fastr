# Hypertext

The *hypertext* component is an [`<a>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a) element which accepts children. *Hypertexts* most commonly appear as inline elements within the context of a sentence or a paragraph.

## Usage

Use *hypertext* when you need to navigate the user to more information about the text that was selected. *Hypertexts* are best used  as inline elements within the context of a sentence or a paragraph. Keep *hypertext* to just a few words, 4-5 max, not entire sentences. *Hypertext* without an `href` prop should appear as normal text.

## Accessibility

A *hypertext* should have two points of visual distinction when *inline*. The underline and visual state colors are both required for accessibility.
