# Radio

*Radio* buttons are designed for selecting one value out of a set. Therefore, *radio* buttons are almost always listed together in groups.

## Usage

Only one *radio* button within a group of items can be selected at the same time. Limit the *radio* label to a single line.

## Style guidance

Do not put two [radio groups](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/radio#Defining_a_radio_group) next to each other. When two radio groups are right next to each other, itâ€™s difficult to determine which *radios* belong to which group. Use a *label* to separate the groups.
