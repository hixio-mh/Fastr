# Caption

*Caption* component can help provide context to images, figures, or tables.

## Usage

*Caption* should be used sparingly. Due to the small font size of *caption*, legibility may suffer, so it should not be used for long descriptions or as a paragraph. It should add informational value without being a distraction. *Captions* are also used for footnotes or as secondary text to provide additional information.

## Style guidance

The default size is 1, with an additional smaller size at 2.
