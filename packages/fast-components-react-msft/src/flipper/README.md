# Flipper

## Accessibility

Hidden from assistive technologies by default as they are typically a secondary method of navigation, which can otherwise be confusing for users. Set the `visibleToAssistiveTechnologies` prop to change this. When exposing *flipper* to screen readers, be sure to also pass the `label` prop.
