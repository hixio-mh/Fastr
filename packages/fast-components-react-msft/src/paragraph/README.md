# Paragraph

The *paragraph* component accepts children.

Be mindful of when and where *paragraphs* appear, as well as their overall size. In certain types of page layouts, *paragraph* is entirely appropriate and may constitute the majority of the page, whereas, in other layouts, such as one optimized for quick browsing and listings, large *paragraphs* can impede the usability of the pageâ€™s content. The best rule of thumb is to only allow the *paragraph* to be as big as it needs to be, and then cut it down by 25-50%. Keep it short and simple.

## Usage

*Paragraph* sizing is intended to coordinate with headings and subheadings according to the standard type ramp. In general, use the same numerical size for the *paragraph* as its associated heading or subheading.

## Accessibility

Semantically meaningful content is especially important for accessibility. Use *paragraph* for all content that should be interpreted as *paragraph* text. While you could achieve similar styling using a div or many other elements, the semantics might get lost and thus negatively impact accessibility and search engine optimization.
