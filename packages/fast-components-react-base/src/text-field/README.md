# Text field 
A [text field](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/text) is a form component using an input type of text, which allows users to input and edit textual data.

## Accessibility
A *text field* with the **readonly** attribute is focusable and should have **aria-label="Read only"**. When applicable, define appropriate input restrictions by using the pattern property to govern what a user is allowed to input in a *text field*. Pre-fill text fields with known strings when possible. It is recommended to have some sort of hint text inside and/or *label* above the text fields to indicate what kind of text input the user should type.
