# Tabs
Use *tabs* when there is a paged interface where one controlling tab element corresponds to one tab panel.

## Accessibility
The *tabs* component is based off the [WAI-ARIA spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#tabpanel). It utilizes activation on left/right keyboard buttons for navigation through the tab list and the home and end keyboard buttons to navigate to the beginning and end tabs respectively.
