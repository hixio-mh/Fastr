# Hypertext
The *hypertext* component is an [anchor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a) element which accepts children. *Hypertexts* most commonly appear as inline elements within the context of a sentence or a paragraph.

## Accessibility
A *hypertext* should have two points of visual distinction when *inline*.
