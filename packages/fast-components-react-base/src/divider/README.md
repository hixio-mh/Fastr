# Divider
The *divider* component defines a thematic break or shift of topic within a page. It is based on the standard [hr](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/hr) element.

## Accessibility
The *divider* is intrinsically set as `role="separator"`, and therefore is not necessary to explicitly define this role. Apply `role="presentation"` when usage involves changing the look of the page but does not have all the functional, interactive, or structural relevance implied by the `hr` element. Learn more from [W3C Recommendations](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/grouping-content.html#the-hr-element).
