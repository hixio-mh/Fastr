# Toggle
*Toggle* mimics a physical switch that allows users to turn things **on** or **off**. If any extra step is required for changes to be effective, you should use *checkbox* and corresponding "Apply" button instead of *toggle*. Users shouldnâ€™t do something else or go somewhere else in order to experience the *toggle's* effect.

## Accessibility
The functionality of *toggle* is very similar to a typical [checkbox](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#checkbox), but without the third state (indeterminate).
