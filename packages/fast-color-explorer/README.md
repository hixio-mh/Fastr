# Introduction 
Application for testing UI color system.

## Getting Started
Follow setup instructions in (https://github.com/Microsoft/fast-dna/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)(https://github.com/Microsoft/fast-dna/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

- Running the app locally: `npm start`
- Build production app: `npm run build`

## Testing
- Run all tests: `npm test`
- tslint all files: `npm run tslint`

## Troubleshooting
- The application uses service-workers, which means views might not update as expected during the development process. To ensure files are updated when changed, you can configure your developer tools to update the assets on reload: (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40783790/disable-service-workers-when-in-development-mode).
